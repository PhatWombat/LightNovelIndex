								irresistible premise: a class of junior high school students is taken to a deserted island where, 
								as part of a ruthless authoritarian program, they are provided arms and forced to kill one another 
								until only one survivor is left standing. Criticized as violent exploitation when first published

								Rock (Okajima Rokuro) was just a normal Japanese businessman, but through a series of unlikely events, he found himself part of the "Lagoon 
								Company," a group of transporters who do a little pirating on the side. Together with Dutch, Revy, and Benny, he sails the seas of Asia 
								aboard the modified torpedo boat "Black Lagoon."

								Their base, the lawless city of Roanapur, is just barely balanced on the brink of outright war, controlled and occupied by criminal 
								organizations from across the globe. At the head of the pack are Balalaika of Russia and Chang of Hong Kong.

								Our story finds Roanapur just a little while before Rock, with Revy in tow, is due to head back to his old home of Japan.

								It is a tale about soldiers who once fought united under a cause in a land of sandy winds, the strictly personal reunion of a captain and her
								one-time subordinate...

								the book's kinda divided into three separate storylines with varying degrees of seriousness. I think that together they kinda manage to touch
								on everything that Black Lagoon has to offer, from the bleak and serious (dare I say grimdark?) parts to the the more humorous off-the-wall 
								bits.

								12,090 A.D. It is a dark time for the world. Humanity is just crawling out from under three hundred years of domination by the race of vampires 
								known as the Nobility. The war against the vampires has taken its toll; cities lie in ruin, the countryside is fragmented into small villages 
								and fiefdoms that still struggle against nightly raids by the fallen vampires-and the remnants of their genetically manufactured demons and 
								werewolves.

								Every village wants a Hunter-one of the warriors who have pledged their laser guns and their swords to the eradication of the Nobility. But some 
								Hunters are better than others, and some bring their own kind of danger with them...

								Brimming with swords, sorcery, and wit, Orconomics: A Satire introduces Arth, a world much like our own but 
								with more magic and fewer vowels. For the licensed wizards and warriors of Arth, slaying and looting the forces
								of evil is just a job. The Heroes' Guild has turned adventuring into a career, selling the rights to monsters’ 
								hoards of treasure as investment opportunities. Corporations spend immense sums sponsoring heroes to undertake 
								quests, betting they’ll reap the profits in plunder funds when the loot is divvied up.<br><br>

								Questing was all business for famous Dwarven berserker Gorm Ingerson, until a botched expedition wiped out his 
								party, disgraced his name, and reduced him to a thieving vagabond. Twenty years later, a chance encounter sees 
								Gorm forcibly recruited by a priest of a mad goddess to undertake a quest that has a reputation for getting 
								heroes killed. But there’s more to Gorm’s new job than an insane prophecy; powerful corporations and 
								governments have shown an unusual interest in the job. Gorm might be able to turn a bad deal into a golden 
								opportunity and win back the fame and fortune he lost so long ago.<br><br>

								Promising fun, fantasy, and financial calamity, Orconomics: A Satire is the first book in The Dark Profit Saga,
								an economically epic trilogy.
